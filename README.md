# Deploying Vision Models (TensorFlow) from ðŸ¤— Transformers

_By Chansung Park and Sayak Paul_

This repository shows various ways of deploying a vision model (TensorFlow) from ðŸ¤— Transformers using the TensorFlow Ecosystem. In particular, we use TensorFlow Serving (for local deployment), Vertex AI (serveless deployment), Kubernetes and GKE (more controlled deployment).

## Methods covered

- [x] TensorFlow Serving locally 
- [x] Vertex AI (without TensorFlow Runtime)
- [ ] Vertex AI (with TensorFlow Runtime)
- [x] Kubernetes with GKE

Know more about the optimized TensorFlow runtime [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/optimized-tensorflow-runtime).

A more detailed README will be added later.
